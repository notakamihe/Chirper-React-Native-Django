# Chirper-React-Native-Django
This is a revamped version of my first React Native Project. This time Django is used to provide a functional backend that the frontend can easily communicate with. The project is based off of Twitter hence the name "Chirper". Users can register, login, post a "chirp", view the feed, and interact with the dashboard.
